Important Rules for Strings

    The Null Terminator (\0): Without this, printf won't know where the string ends and will keep printing random data from your memory until it crashes.

    Array Bounds: Always make sure your char array is large enough to hold the text plus the null character.

    Comparison: You cannot use if (str1 == str2). This compares the memory addresses, not the text. Always use strcmp().
