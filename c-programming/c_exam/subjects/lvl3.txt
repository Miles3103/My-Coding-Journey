=== LEVEL 3 - SYNTAX [1/3] : Program Structure ===
FILE: rendu/lvl3/task.c

Write a well-structured C program that:
  1. Has a file header comment (author, date, description)
  2. Has a helper function ft_print(char *s) using write()
     that prints the string + newline
  3. Calls ft_print("Syntax is power") from main

Expected output:
  Syntax is power

Tip: Function must be declared BEFORE main or use a prototype.
