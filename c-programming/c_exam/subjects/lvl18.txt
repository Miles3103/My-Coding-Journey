FILE: rendu/lvl18/task.c

  1. int i = 65; char c = i; print c as char -> 'A'
  2. char ch = 'z'; int n = ch; print n -> 122
  3. int a=5, b=2; double d = a / b; print -> 2.000000
  4. double e = (double)a / b; print -> 2.500000

Expected output:
  char from int: A
  int from char: 122
  int division stored as double: 2.000000
  cast before division: 2.500000

Tip: Division happens BEFORE assignment in line 3!
