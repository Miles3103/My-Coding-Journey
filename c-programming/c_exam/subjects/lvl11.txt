=== LEVEL 11 - COMMENTS [3/3] : Commented Debugging ===
FILE: rendu/lvl11/task.c

Write a program with a BUGGY version commented out
and a FIXED version active. Comment explaining the bug.

The bug: multiplying instead of adding
  // int result = a * b;  /* BUG: should be addition */
  int result = a + b;     /* FIX: correct operation */

With a = 6, b = 4, print: Sum: 10

Expected output:
  Sum: 10
