Write: int ft_percent(int part, int total)
Returns the integer percentage.
Example: ft_percent(1, 3) = 33

Test in main:
  1 of 3   = 33%
  2 of 3   = 66%
  1 of 4   = 25%
  3 of 4   = 75%
  1 of 7   = 14%

Expected output:
  1 of 3   = 33%
  2 of 3   = 66%
  1 of 4   = 25%
  3 of 4   = 75%
  1 of 7   = 14%

Tip: (int)((double)part / total * 100)
