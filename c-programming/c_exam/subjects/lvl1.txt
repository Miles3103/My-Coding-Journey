=== LEVEL 1 - C INTRO [2/3] : Return Values ===
FILE: rendu/lvl1/task.c

Write a C program that:
  1. Prints "Program starting" using write()
  2. Prints "Program done" using write()
  3. Returns 0 from main

Add a comment at the top:
  /* Q: What does returning 0 mean? What does returning 1 mean? */

Expected output:
  Program starting
  Program done

Tip: Non-zero return = error code (Unix convention).
