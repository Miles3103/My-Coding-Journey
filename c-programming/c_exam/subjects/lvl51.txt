=== LEVEL 51 - USER INPUT [1/3] : read() Buffer ===
FILE: rendu/lvl51/task.c

Using ONLY read() and write():
  1. Read up to 32 chars from stdin into buffer
  2. Null-terminate the buffer
  3. Strip trailing newline
  4. Write: "You entered: " then the buffer

Test: piped input "Hello42"

Expected output:
  You entered: Hello42

Tip: read() returns number of bytes read.
     buf[bytes] = '\0' to null-terminate.
