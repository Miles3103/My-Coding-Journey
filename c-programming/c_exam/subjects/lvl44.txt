=== LEVEL 44 - BREAK/CONTINUE [3/3] : Nested Loop Control ===
FILE: rendu/lvl44/task.c

Print pairs (i,j) where i and j are 1-5 and i*j is a perfect square.
Use continue to skip non-perfect-squares.

Expected output (include all valid pairs):
  (1,1)=1
  (1,4)=4
  (2,2)=4
  (3,3)=9
  (4,4)=16
  (5,5)=25

Tip: Check if (int)sqrt(x) * (int)sqrt(x) == x
     Include <math.h> and compile with -lm
