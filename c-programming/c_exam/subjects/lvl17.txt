=== LEVEL 17 - DATA TYPES [3/3] : Unsigned vs Signed ===
FILE: rendu/lvl17/task.c

  1. signed char sc = -1; unsigned char uc = (unsigned char)sc;
     Print:
       signed char:   -1
       unsigned char: 255

  2. unsigned int ui = 0; ui = ui - 1;
     Print: unsigned underflow: 4294967295

Expected output:
  signed char:   -1
  unsigned char: 255
  unsigned underflow: 4294967295

Tip: Unsigned types wrap around (well-defined in C).
